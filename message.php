                        I would like to take this opportunity to extend a warm greeting to you all on behalf of the
                        Organizing Committee of the eighth edition of IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing
                        and Communication (ICSC 2022). The conference will include an exceptional technical programme,
                        which I am convinced will provide all the participants an engaging experience and stimulate
                        exciting collaborative research. <br><br>
                        The Eighth IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication (ICSC 2022) will
                        offer an ideal international venue for the exchange of knowledge and findings in theory,
                        methodology, and applications of signal and image processing and communication. The purpose of
                        the conference is to provide researchers and practitioners working in industry and academic
                        institutions the opportunity to interact with one another and discuss recent advances in
                        relevant subjects. <br><br>
                        Because of the unpredictability of the pandemic, we have chosen to have a virtual event, which
                        has its own set of challenges, both in terms of technology and logistics. But the ease of
                        attending the conference from anywhere in the world without involving any travel overcomes all
                        other limitations. At our end, we have made every effort to ensure that the conference goes off
                        without a hitch.
                        We hope that throughout your time at the conference, you will not only be able to have a good
                        time but also be successful in gaining knowledge about new research in your area.
