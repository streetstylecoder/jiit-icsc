                            The conference will adhere to accepted stringent norms as regards plagiarism. Authors are
                            advised to use standard softwareâ€™s to check similarity prior to loading their work. Rejection of
                            submission without review can be on the basis of high similarity. The maximum similarity allowed
                            is less than or equal to 20% only.

                            work or based on experimental results. Any ambiguity on the data analyzed to be accepted will be
                            at the discretion of reviewers. Reviewer(s) may recommend for major revision or reject the
                            paper.
