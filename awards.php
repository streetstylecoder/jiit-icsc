                        The Best Paper Awards are presented at ICSC conferences to authors whose work represents
                        groundbreaking research in their respective areas. By recognizing these select papers for their
                        ingenuity and importance, ICSC highlights some of the theoretical and practical innovations that
                        are likely to shape the future especially in the areas of Signal Processing, Communication and
                        VLSI Technology and Embedded Systems. The accepted works which are properly presented in the
                        conference as per the guidelines of ICSC 2022 will only be considered for "Best Paper Award".

                        Below, you can find the list of the recipients of the Best Paper Award of previous Conference:
